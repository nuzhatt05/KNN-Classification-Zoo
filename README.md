# K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) - Zoo Dataset

This repository is focused on implementing **K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)** for animal classification using the `Zoo.csv` dataset.  
The assignment demonstrates preprocessing, visualization, training the KNN classifier, and evaluating its performance.

---

## Objective
To apply the **K-Nearest Neighbours algorithm** for classifying animals into types based on their physical and biological attributes.  
This assignment provides practice with distance metrics, hyperparameter tuning, and decision boundary visualization.

## Dataset Description

The **Zoo dataset** contains various animal attributes with the following columns:

- **animal name** – Name of the animal  
- **hair, feathers, eggs, milk, airborne, aquatic, predator, toothed, backbone, breathes, venomous, fins, tail, domestic, catsize** – Binary or categorical features representing animal traits  
- **legs** – Number of legs  
- **type** – Target variable (animal class/category)
